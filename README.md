# Peer Tutoring - Computer Science

Hello PEER Tutors! Here are the custom-drawn PowerPoint presentations. Take note that the average number of slides are 230+ but they can be presented in less than 1 hour (except the pointers and linked lists part because it requires in-depth F2F tablet drawings, but still it depends on the presenter). The number is high due to extra slide animations only.

## Helpers

Discover useful helper scripts in the `Helpers` folder. These scripts are designed to automate common tasks and streamline processes within your workflow, aiming to simplify tasks and improve efficiency in your daily activities.

## Presentations

Access presentation files and materials in the `Presentations` folder. This folder contains the slides, documents, and other resources used in our tutoring sessions. Feel free to review these materials to reinforce your understanding of the topics covered during our presentations.

### Available Presentations:

- **CMSC 12** - Strings, Lists, Dictionaries (Yves)
- **CMSC 21** - Arrays and Strings (Yves)
- **CMSC 21** - Pointers and Linked Lists (Yves)

Happy presenting!
